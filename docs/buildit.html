                                        In today’s world of getting things quickly, the R/C hobby is quickly losing the art, and reward of building a
                                        model
                                        from scratch or from a kit. Almost ready to fly (ARF) and Bind and fly (BNF) planes are being sold at an
                                        increasing
                                        pace; however, building from scratch instills a sense of pride, and ensures you will have a well-built aircraft
                                        that
                                        will stand the test of time. I have been building model aircraft for several years and have built many styles.
                                        Through these instructions, I’m going to show you how to build a plane properly, and select the right radio gear
                                        for
                                        the plane, as well as options for a power source. It’s not as hard as you may think, so let’s get started now!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The first thing you need do in any balsa aircraft build is make sure you have the correct tools before jumping
                                        in.
                                        Nothing is more frustrating than getting to a certain point and realizing that you don’t have the correct tool,
                                        or
                                        part that you need to continue. Open the kit box and look through the manual. Depending on the model you select,
                                        the
                                        instructions can be very detailed, or very vague, but in all of them you will have at least a parts list, a list
                                        of
                                        general tools, and a sheet diagram or parts blowup. You can also look over the plans for a general idea of what
                                        you’ll be getting into and sometimes, that can be very helpful. In general, you will need a good quality hobby
                                        knife
                                        and a set of different blades. These come in assortment packs that can be very helpful for different tasks
                                        during
                                        the build, but make sure you have several #11 blades, as these will be used most often. Furthermore, another
                                        helpful
                                        tool will be a razor saw for cutting bass wood and the plywood, if needed. In addition, I also recommend medium
                                        and
                                        thin Cyanoacrylate (CA) Glue, 5-minute epoxy (or longer), kicker for fast curing of the CA glue, wax paper, and
                                        T-pins.

                                        The next thing to make sure you have before starting is a sturdy work area. I use a work bench that is mounted
                                        on
                                        the wall, but whatever you use, make sure that the work area is at least the length of the wing you are working
                                        on.
                                        Even if the wing separates for transport or storage, you will assemble all the parts at one point to line
                                        everything
                                        up, and you don’t want to be doing this on the kitchen table or the floor. I have seen other builders use a door
                                        on
                                        saw horses, or plywood, but whatever you use make sure it is straight and true because if your build surface
                                        isn’t,
                                        your plane won’t be. Moreover, you need some cork tiles, insulating foam used in the construction industry, or
                                        something that you can easily stick, and remove, your T-pins to secure your build. Stainless steel and rare
                                        earth
                                        magnets are also a good choice to hold your parts together. After you have the build surface ready, open your
                                        kit
                                        and make sure you have all the parts. I like to lay them out in organized piles for the wing, the fuselage, and
                                        the
                                        tail sections. Refer to your manual and the plans to make sure everything is there before you begin. In
                                        addition,
                                        check that you have all the hardware that should be included.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The first two steps are very important to make sure you have a successful, fun build. Now we get to start
                                        working on
                                        the plane. With your work area clear of any debris, and your soft board under where you’ll be working, roll your
                                        plans out on the table. Lay the wax paper over the portion of the plan you will be working on and use the T-pins
                                        to
                                        secure everything down tightly. Now, follow the instructions on how to correctly assemble your particular model.
                                        In
                                        general, you’ll assemble the tail sections then the wing followed by the fuselage. Some kits will have you fit
                                        certain parts like the engine, pushrods, fuel tank, or radio equipment during the build. We’ll cover these
                                        things in
                                        the next few paragraphs. When all parts of the plane (wing, fuselage, tail etc...) have been built, the wood
                                        needs
                                        to be carefully sanded to a smooth finish, particularly the joints. Any unwanted holes and other imperfections
                                        can
                                        be filled with lightweight filler and then sanded to shape. For many, including myself, sanding is the most
                                        unpleasant part of the build, but it's worth taking the time because any lumps and bumps in the airframe will
                                        show
                                        through the covering and potentially spoil the look of the finished plane. It’s worth taking your time with the
                                        sanding and getting a nice finish. Use fine-grade sand papers such as 400, 600 and 800 grit for example.

                                        With your model assembled and sanded, it’s time to get it covered! This is personally my favorite part because
                                        this
                                        will be when your plane starts to really look like a plane. There are several different types of covering to
                                        choose
                                        from like tissue or silk and “dope” that shrinks as it dries. The easiest and most modern way is to use a
                                        plastic
                                        film that you apply with an iron and shrink with a heat gun. It is made by several manufacturers, and comes in
                                        many
                                        different colors, and even comes in clear colors if you want to show off your woodwork.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now that your plane is covered, it’s time to install radio equipment. The basic components of a typical radio
                                        control system are the transmitter, receiver and servos. Battery packs are needed to power all the components.
                                        However, receivers and servos of modern electric power (EP) r/c airplanes don't usually have their own battery
                                        pack
                                        because their power is taken directly from the motor battery pack through the electronic speed controller (ESC).
                                        There is an almost unlimited amount of choices, but while making this choice its wise not to skimp in this area.
                                        A
                                        common and reliable system that is introductory priced would be the Spektrum Dx6, Tactic ttx660, or Futaba 6J
                                        Systems. These are great 6 channel Transmitters that will get you started, and offers a couple extra channels to
                                        allow you to use dual aileron servos, flaps, lights or other features. However, when deciding on a receiver, it
                                        must
                                        match your radio brand. There are conversion kits to use different receivers, but the easiest and safest way is
                                        to
                                        keep it simple and go with the same brand.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        In contrast, with Servos there are many choices as well, but the brand doesn’t have to match the radio. Let’s
                                        say
                                        you go with Tactic TX and RX you can, but don’t have to, go with a Tactic servo. You can use a Futaba servo just
                                        the
                                        same. I can’t stress enough the importance of getting the best for your budget, so do some research and check
                                        reviews and see what others think and how the reliability is. You don’t want to crash an airplane due to a
                                        faulty
                                        servo because you tried to save a couple dollars.

                                        Furthermore, you need to think about what engine you are going to use. You will need to choose glow, gas, or
                                        electric power. There are benefits to both. With glow or gas power, you have a scale motor that sounds good, and
                                        you
                                        don’t have to wait for batteries to charge, but you will have more maintenance like keeping the motor clean,
                                        glow
                                        plugs, and after every flying session you’ll have to clean the oil off your plane. However, with electric power
                                        your
                                        plane will always be clean; it’s quiet, and there is very little maintenance, but you will have to constantly
                                        charge
                                        batteries and carry a charger with you if you want to fly more after your batteries are discharged. There are
                                        many
                                        options either way you decide to go.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Lastly, you must balance your plane. Go to your local hobby shop and buy a balancer, pick one up online, or go
                                        to
                                        your local hardware store and get some pvc pipe and couplers to make your own. It needs to have a base and be
                                        about
                                        18” tall. This will accommodate most fuselages. Look at your plans and your manual for proper balancing.
                                        Generally,
                                        it is at the main spar of the wing and forward about ¼ inch. This is one of the most important steps, in fact,
                                        if
                                        you get this wrong, your plane will be extremely unstable, if airworthy at all. A little nose heavy is ok, as it
                                        will make it more responsive; but if it’s tail heavy you will have an extremely hard time controlling it. These
                                        are
                                        the basic steps to complete any model, and I hope you will jump in and be a part of a hobby that’s been around
                                        since
                                        the 1930’s!

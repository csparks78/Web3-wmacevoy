                                        Club, private land or public area?
                                        These are pretty much your three options for finding somewhere to fly rc
                                        airplanes.
                                    </p>

                                        Flying at an rc airplane clubIt could be that you have an rc flying club close
                                        to where you live - use the rc
                                        airplane club directory
                                        in this website to see if there's one within a convenient distance from home. If
                                        there is, do consider joining
                                        especially if you're
                                        thinking of flying IC powered planes. Such airplanes are more involved than your
                                        typical electric park flyer, so
                                        help from other
                                        modellers is always a good thing.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        If there's a club nearby but you don't want to join, it's a very good idea to
                                        pop along to their field one
                                        weekend and talk to the
                                        members about flying in the area. Frequency interference is a very serious issue
                                        and can't be ignored if there's
                                        potential for conflict.

                                        While it's true that most of us are using 2.4GHz radios these days, it's still
                                        very possible that you have
                                        bought an rc airplane
                                        that utilises a traditional MHz radio system. This is where you have to be very
                                        concerned about radio
                                        interference from or to other
                                        flyers nearby. If you and another flyer are both using a MHz radio within close
                                        range (a mile or less) then you
                                        need to be sure about
                                        who is on which frequency.
                                    </p>

                                        Flying your rc airplane from private landIf you're lucky enough to have access
                                        to private open land - either
                                        your own or a
                                        friendly farmer's - then you can fly from this so long as you have permission to
                                        do so. Private land is the
                                        preferable option
                                        over flying from somewhere public, because you can pretty much do what you like
                                        when you like, without the worry
                                        of being yelled
                                        at by a member of the public who doesn't like rc airplanes!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Of course, it could be that you've bought an ultra micro type electric rc plane
                                        and that your back yard is big
                                        enough to fly
                                        it in. Lucky you, you're in an enviable position!

                                        Flying your rc airplane from a public areaYour final option is to fly your plane
                                        from a public area. Depending
                                        on the
                                        size and type of your airplane, suitable locations include public parks, sports
                                        fields, ball parks, beaches,
                                        open hill sides....
                                        You get the idea.
                                    </p>

                                        Public areas are good for flying rc airplanes - with care!
                                        Above: public fields are great for flying rc airplanes,
                                        so long as it's permitted!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The crucial thing to remember when flying in a public area is safety. Read these
                                        rc flying do's and don'ts for
                                        flying your rc
                                        airplane from such a place, and always use common sense and act responsibly.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        As strange as it might seem, not everyone in the world enjoys watching an rc
                                        airplane zooming around the sky.
                                        It only takes the wrong kind of person to complain to a local authority, and
                                        that location can quickly and
                                        easily be shut down
                                        to model flyers. So always always think about where you're flying, and be
                                        responsible. None of us want this
                                        hobby to get a bad reputation.
                                    </p>

                                        On that note, the radio control flying hobby has never been in the public eye as
                                        much as it now, thanks to the
                                        popularity
                                        of rc drones. We're all at risk of being caught up in strict new rules and
                                        regulations, so choosing a suitable
                                        flying site is
                                        more important now than it ever has been. And watch this space, because things
                                        are only set to become tighter as
                                        governing bodies
                                        crack down on UAV operations.

                                        Wherever you want to fly from, your flying location needs to be open and
                                        spacious. The size of your plane will
                                        determine what size
                                        area you need to fly in, but for, say, a 40 inch wingspan electric RTF airplane
                                        a ball park would provide ample
                                        airspace -
                                        that should give you an idea of the kind of area you should be looking for.

                                        Tip: when searching for local flying sites, use Google Earth, Google Maps or
                                        Windows Live satellite imagery -
                                        it's simply the best
                                        way of searching your area quickly!
                                    </p>

                                        Other things to note when looking at where to fly rc airplanes include:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Presence of objects such as trees, posts, pylons, lights, power lines etc.
                                        How close members of the public will be to you while you're flying.
                                        Proximity of houses, schools, offices, shops etc.
                                        Proximity of roads and highways; rc planes can be a big distraction to some
                                        drivers.
                                        The bottom line is that you need a large(ish) open space where there is no
                                        danger of causing trouble, being
                                        a
                                        nuisance or risking
                                        damage to people or property. And on that note, you absolutely must check local
                                        regulations and laws to see
                                        if
                                        flying radio control
                                        aircraft is even permitted. If it's not, and you take to the skies, you could
                                        well have an angry official
                                        breathing down your neck and
                                        writing you a ticket!
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Another point to make is that of the sun position. The last thing you want is to
                                        be flying across the sun
                                        (this
                                        is a definite no-no),
                                        so do pay attention to where the sun is in relation to where you'll be flying.
                                        The ideal situation is for
                                        the sun to be behind you so
                                        there's no danger of being blinded as you're flying.
